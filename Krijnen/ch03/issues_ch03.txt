# 3.1.1, example 1:

To visualize the Binomial distribution, load the TeachingDemos
package and use the command vis.binom(). Click on ”Show Normal Approximation” and observe that the approximation improves as n increases,
taking p for instance near 0.5.

Are they expecting these to be done in like Rstudio or something?

# when things slow down a bit, I plan to go back and do the exercises for each of the first five chapters.
