# So the mathematical equations..... how well should I be understanding them?

Know that the distributions exist and what they are used for.  

# 3.1.1, example 1:

To visualize the Binomial distribution, load the TeachingDemos
package and use the command vis.binom(). Click on ”Show Normal Approximation” and observe that the approximation improves as n increases,
taking p for instance near 0.5.

Are they expecting these to be done in like Rstudio or something?

I don't think so.  It loaded fine for me, although the slider bar was behind my graph, so it was hidden at first.
It may be a mac issue, although R is supposed to be platform independent, but mac does use quartz as a visualizer, whereas
linux and windows use x11

# when things slow down a bit, I plan to go back and do the exercises for each of the first five chapters.
