# 4.1.7 example 4 discusses Fisher's exact test. the differential expression program that I am using, edgeR, uses this method. Can we talk about this in more detail?

Yes.

# couldn't get library(nortest) to load. Says there is no package.. must have missed this somewhere ** can't get library(outliers) either

Interesting.  I thought maybe that there were package requirements that you didn't install already, but there apears to be minimal requirements
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/outliers/index.html
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/nortest/index.html

rerun
install.packages("nortest")
and see if it produces errors.  
Same with outliers

Here is example output from installation:
