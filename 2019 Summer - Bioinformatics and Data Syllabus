SUCCESS

Please inform me of any disabilities or special needs that may impact your performance in this course.  I will do my best to accommodate you and support your success in this class.   

ATTENDANCE

Attendance is required as daily updates to the course website (https://github.com/sdmiller93/Summ3) and partipation in meetings, whether in-person, online, or over the phone.  If you miss a day, you must contact me BEFORE the next class to determine if you are eligible to make up the points.  Valid excuses are documented illness or injury, death in the family, jury duty, participation in University-sponsored activities, etc. on a case-by-case basis.

GRADING

Activity				Course Points		Percentage of Grade	
Programming Exercises				100			50%	
Final Project					100			50%
Total						200

Programming Exercises: Daily exercises to teach bioinformatic tools, data analysis, and data visualization and test on the understanding of the techniques and tools.  Completed excercises to be uploaded daily to course website.

Final Project: Project designed in collaboration with the instructor and research advisors to analyze a data set using tools and techniques developed in the class.   Final results to reported as a written report as well as presentation.

Grading Scale: The lower limits for each letter grade is: A = 93%; A- = 90%; B+ = 87%; B = 83%; B- = 80%; C+ = 77%; C = 73%; C- = 70%; D+ = 67%; D = 63%; D- = 60%. Anything below 60% is an F.

Honesty

Cheating and plagiarism, defined in Millersville University’s Student Handbook and Academic Honesty and Dishonesty brochure, will result in a 0 for the exam or assignment.  Further action may be taken, such as referral to Student Affairs and failure of the class.  I understand you talk to your fellow students and may work together on in-class exercises, but you must turn in your own work.

TITLE IX

Millersville University and its faculty are committed to assuring a safe and productive educational environment for all students. In order to meet this commitment, comply with Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. §1681, et seq., and act in accordance with guidance from the Office for Civil Rights, the University requires faculty members to report to the University’s Title IX Coordinator incidents of sexual violence shared by students. The only exceptions to the faculty member’s reporting obligation are when incidents of sexual violence are communicated by a student during a classroom discussion, in a writing assignment for a class, or as part of a University-approved research project. Faculty members are obligated to report to the person designated in the University Protection of Minors policy incidents of sexual violence or any other abuse of a student who was, or is, a child (a person under 18 years of age) when the abuse allegedly occurred.
Information regarding the reporting of sexual violence, and the resources that are available to victims of sexual violence, is available at www.millersville.edu/titleix
