## NOTES FOR CH02

three components of every plot:
1. data
2. aesthetics 
3. geoms

gplot() is a shortcut to quickly bang out a simple plot without thinking about grammar

# EXERCISES
1. summary, library(skimr)
skim(df) shows missing values, quantile info, and inline histograms, mean()
2. data () shows datasets in package
3. miles/gallon --> X gallon/62 miles 
4. **

# ggplot2 plot key components
1. data
2. set of aesthetic mappings between variables and visual properties
3. at least one layer describing how to render each observation 

* layers are created with the geom function

data & aesthetic are supplied in ggplot() 
layers are added on with + geom_XXXX

the first two unnamed arguments to aes() will be mapped to x and then y
